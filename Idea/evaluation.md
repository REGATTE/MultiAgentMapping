# Simulation-Only Evaluation for Pose-Graph SLAM vs Surfel-Based SLAM

## 1. Generate and Configure Simulation Data

### **Simulated Environments:**
- Use Isaac Sim’s built-in environments (e.g., warehouses, outdoor terrains).
- Import custom 3D maps in **USD, FBX, or OBJ** formats for complex layouts (e.g., urban areas).
- Add **dynamic obstacles** to simulate real-world complexity.

### **Sensor Setup:**
- Attach **LiDAR, IMU, and odometry sensors** to robots.
- Simulate **sensor noise** to test robustness (Gaussian noise can be added).
- Record sensor outputs into **ROS bags** for reproducible testing.

## 2. Evaluation Metrics

### **A. Trajectory Evaluation**
1. **Ground Truth Paths:**
   - Use Isaac Sim’s **pose ground truth publisher** for robot positions.
2. **Trajectory Comparison:**
   - Compute errors between estimated and ground truth trajectories:
     - **Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE)** for global accuracy.
     - **Relative Pose Error (RPE)** for local consistency.
3. **Tools:**
   - **evo**: Python library for evaluating trajectories.
     ```
     evo_ape sim groundtruth.txt estimated.txt --plot --save_results results.json
     evo_rpe sim groundtruth.txt estimated.txt --plot
     ```
   - **MATLAB** or **Python** for custom error plotting.

### **B. Map Quality Evaluation**
1. **Point Cloud Alignment:**
   - Compare generated maps (**PCD files**) with simulated ground truth maps.
   - Use **ICP alignment** or metrics like **Chamfer Distance** to evaluate accuracy.
2. **Map Completeness:**
   - Measure **percentage of area covered** relative to the environment’s total size.
3. **Tools:**
   - **CloudCompare** for visualizing and comparing point clouds.
   - **Open3D** in Python for automated map evaluation.

### **C. Performance Metrics**
1. **Runtime Efficiency:**
   - Log computation time per frame (**ms**) to assess real-time capability.
   - Profile **CPU/GPU usage** during SLAM processing.
2. **Memory Usage:**
   - Monitor memory growth as the map scales, especially for **Surfel SLAM**.
3. **Simulation Tools:**
   ```
   nvidia-smi --query-gpu=utilization.gpu,utilization.memory --format=csv
   ```
   - **Isaac Sim Profiler** for internal performance measurements.

### **D. Robustness Testing**
1. **Dynamic Scenarios:**
   - Add **moving obstacles** in simulation to test adaptability.
   - Evaluate map updates when parts of the environment change.
2. **Loop Closure Robustness:**
   - Simulate **long trajectories** with revisits to check loop closure performance.
3. **Noise Injection:**
   - Add artificial noise to sensor data streams to evaluate algorithm robustness:
     ```
     rosparam set /lidar_noise_level 0.05
     ```
