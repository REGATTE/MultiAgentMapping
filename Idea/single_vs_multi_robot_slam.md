# Single-Robot vs Multi-Robot SLAM Evaluation

## 1. Setup for Single-Robot vs Multi-Robot SLAM

### **Single-Robot SLAM:**
- Simulate a **single robot** operating independently in the environment.
- Build a **local map** and test trajectory estimation using standard metrics (**ATE, RPE**).
- Focus on **loop closure detection** and **global consistency** in isolated runs.

### **Multi-Robot SLAM:**
- Simulate **two or more robots** operating in the same environment.
- Enable **data sharing** between robots when they are in proximity.
- Perform **inter-robot loop closures** and merge their maps into a **global map**.
- Evaluate how collaboration improves map consistency and reduces drift.

## 2. Metrics for Comparison

| **Metric**                | **Single-Robot SLAM**                     | **Multi-Robot SLAM**                      |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Map Accuracy**          | Limited to the explored area.             | Larger coverage due to collaboration.      |
| **ATE (m)**               | Tracks single trajectory accuracy.        | Tracks combined accuracy from all robots.  |
| **RPE (m)**               | Focuses on local consistency.             | Evaluates consistency across robots.       |
| **Loop Closure Efficiency** | Depends solely on the robot’s revisits.  | More frequent closures due to shared maps. |
| **Computation Time (ms)** | Faster for small areas.                   | Higher processing time due to data merging.|
| **Scalability**           | Suitable for small-scale environments.    | Scalable for large environments.           |
| **Robustness to Failures** | No redundancy—failure affects the entire map.| Redundant coverage improves fault tolerance.|

## 3. Testing Scenarios

1. **Single-Robot SLAM:**
   - Test in **small indoor environments** (e.g., warehouses).
   - Assess loop closure performance and accuracy in isolated paths.

2. **Multi-Robot SLAM:**
   - Test in **large outdoor environments** (e.g., streets, parks).
   - Introduce **dynamic obstacles** and observe how robots adapt collaboratively.  
   - Simulate **data sharing delays** to model real-world conditions.  

3. **Dynamic vs Static Environments:**
   - Evaluate performance in **changing environments** where obstacles appear/disappear.
   - Compare **local map stability** and **global consistency** between approaches.

## 4. Evaluation Process

1. **Single-Robot Evaluation:**
   - Record sensor data and process SLAM output.
   - Compute trajectory errors (**ATE, RPE**) against ground truth paths.
   - Visualize maps and trajectories in **Rviz** or **MATLAB**.

2. **Multi-Robot Evaluation:**
   - Simulate multiple robots and log merged map data.
   - Assess accuracy improvements due to **map merging** and **loop closures**.
   - Measure computation time and memory growth as robot count increases.

3. **Comparison:**
   - Analyze whether **collaboration compensates for added computation costs**.
   - Evaluate **map redundancy** and fault-tolerance benefits with multi-robot SLAM.

## 6. Insights from Comparison

- **Single-Robot SLAM**:
  - Suitable for **small areas** and **low computational resources**.  
  - Limited robustness—failure in localization causes map drift.  

- **Multi-Robot SLAM**:
  - **Faster mapping** due to collaborative coverage.  
  - Better **loop closure performance** reduces drift and improves accuracy.  
  - Increased computation and **data synchronization overhead**.

## 7. Conclusion
By comparing **single-robot and multi-robot SLAM**, you can evaluate trade-offs in **accuracy, scalability, and performance**. Multi-robot SLAM typically outperforms single-robot SLAM in **large and dynamic environments** but requires **higher computational resources** and **synchronization protocols**.
